# Text Summarisation

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for text summarization. The notebook demonstrates techniques for generating concise summaries from longer text inputs.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebook:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- transformers (if using deep learning models)
- torch (if using PyTorch-based models)

You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Text_Summarisation.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess text, apply summarization models, and evaluate results.

## Input & Output
- **Input:** A long-form text document or paragraph.
- **Output:** A concise summary of the input text.

## Methods Used
The notebook may use one or more of the following summarization techniques:
- Extractive summarization (selecting key sentences)
- Abstractive summarization (generating new sentences)
- Pre-trained NLP models (e.g., BERT, T5, GPT-based models)
